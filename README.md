# ViT_Fashion_Classification
This is a model I worked on during Rutgers' HackRU Fall 2023 event. It's still very much a work in progress, but I'm continuing to work and learn more as my academic year ramps up. 
## Purpose of a model like this
My goal for this project is to train and fine-tune a ViT model which can run locally on a user's mobile device with acceptable accuracy. The user will take (or upload) a photo of a piece of clothing, and the model will return searchable keywords for the style and aesthetic category of the clothing. 
## Why do this? Why not use an API? 
The terminology and trend cycle of fashion is evolving at breakneck pace, with microtrends incresingly becoming popular, most often through social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Young people online are categorizing the objects, clothes, and pieces of art they consume in searchable aesthetic terms. I believe that if this process can be aided with machine learning, many young & fashion-oriented Internet users could be greatly helped in their search process for developing their own style and aesthetic.
